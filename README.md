# HTTP Server the Hard Way

HTTP Server for Mono's class.

## Installation
First of all, the `npm` dependencies have to be installed.

```
npm install
```

Afterwards, the server must be compiled.

```
npm run build
```

Then, the `config.json` file must be created; all server configurations go there. An example `config.json.exampe` file is included in the project root.

## Running the server
When the server is compiled and configured, it can be run with `npm start`.
